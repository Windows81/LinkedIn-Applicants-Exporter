Unlike with the original, my modified version exports candidate data as JSON.

Originated from Introview's [LinkedIn Applications Exporter 0.0.25](https://www.crxsoso.com/webstore/detail/nenpfcppjapnadplgpeldoafnfccbjoh).

Modified by VisualPlugin to remove the unnecessary authentication screen.

1. Download entire project as a zipped file.
2. Extract to a directory.
3. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` and load the directory through _Load unpacked_.
4. Profit.
